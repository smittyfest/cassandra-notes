# Introduction to Apache Cassandra

Apache Cassandra is a fast distributed database built forhigh availability and linear scalability.

<p>We want predictable performance so we can get low-latency and guarantee SLA.
<p>We want our cluster to have the same performance as it scales up from five nodes to ten nodes to 1000 nodes.
<p>No SPOF. Apache Cassandra is a peer-to-peer architecutre, so there are no single points of failure, no master-slave, no failover, no leader-election.
<p>Out of the box we can do multi-datacenter.
<p>Commodity hardware.
